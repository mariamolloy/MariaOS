2019 Browser-based Operating System in TypeScript
=================================================

This is Alan's Operating Systems class initial project.
See https://www.labouseur.com/courses/os/ for details.
It was originally developed by Alan and then enhanced by Bob Nisco and Rebecca Murphy over the years.
Fork this (or clone, but fork is probably better in case Alan changes anything about the initial project) into your own private repository. Or download it as a ZIP file. Then add Alan (userid *Labouseur*) as a collaborator.


Grading
================
For iProject1, please grade in the iProject1 branch! NOT the master branch :)

A Few Notes
===========

**What's TypeScript?**
TypeScript is a language that allows you to write in a statically-typed language that outputs standard JavaScript.
It's all kinds of awesome.

**Why should I use it?**
This will be especially helpful for an OS or a Compiler that may need to run in the browser as you will have all of the great benefits of strong type checking and scope rules built right into your language.

**Where can I get more info on TypeScript**
