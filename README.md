2019 Browser-based Operating System in TypeScript
=================================================

This is Alan's Operating Systems class initial project.
See https://www.labouseur.com/courses/os/ for details.
It was originally developed by Alan and then enhanced by Bob Nisco and Rebecca Murphy over the years.
Fork this (or clone, but fork is probably better in case Alan changes anything about the initial project) into your own private repository. Or download it as a ZIP file. Then add Alan (userid *Labouseur*) as a collaborator.


Grading
================
Hi Alan! Please grade on the project 3 branch :) also i know that there is STILL this compile error: "error TS2339: Property 'getContext' does not exist on type 'HTMLElement'.88 var ctx: any = canv.getContext('2d');" but i have been happily ignoring it and i hope you can do the same 


A Few Notes
===========

**What's TypeScript?**
TypeScript is a language that allows you to write in a statically-typed language that outputs standard JavaScript.
It's all kinds of awesome.

**Why should I use it?**
This will be especially helpful for an OS or a Compiler that may need to run in the browser as you will have all of the great benefits of strong type checking and scope rules built right into your language.

**Where can I get more info on TypeScript**
